# Distribution Lane Architecture Repair
Generated: 2026-05-26T15:04:36

Treat this slot as a structural repair, not as another measurement-hold report.
The same empty-board architecture state already repeated twice in this review window.
This run escalates that third strike into a churn guard tied to the board fingerprint instead of emitting another plain repair note.

## Repair applied in this run
- Reconfirmed the current execution board so lane selection uses the latest truthful packet and delivery state.
- Marked repeated post-hold measurement-hold selection as a process failure, not an acceptable steady state.
- Forced the next repair cycle to prefer runtime/process repair over another idle hold when short-window congestion is already gone.
- Suppressed regeneration of the Reddit discussion handoff packet because the latest packet was already manually delivered and is still inside its active review window.
- Installed a third-strike churn guard for repeated empty-board architecture repairs with the same execution-board fingerprint.

## Current source of truth
- Consolidated execution board: /home/mistlight/.openclaw/workspace/drafts/2026-05-26_marketing_execution_board.md

## Next structural requirements
- Do not re-enter measurement_hold without active short-window congestion or a newer live external action after the last hold.
- The next truthful slot must choose either an untouched executable lane or another concrete runtime repair.
- Keep Codeberg as the primary CTA and keep duplicate packet delivery fail-closed.
