For a TypeScript/Next.js fintech workflow, I would avoid agent-to-agent freeform handoffs and make the system event-driven with explicit contracts.

A practical production shape is:

1. **One orchestrator, many workers.** Keep planning/routing in one service, but execute work through queue-backed workers so retries and back-pressure are controlled instead of cascading.
2. **Per-step idempotency keys.** Every webhook, tool call, and downstream write should carry an idempotency key so retries are safe.
3. **State machine per job.** Persist states like `planned -> executing -> verifying -> awaiting-review -> done/failed` in the database instead of inferring state from logs or chat history.
4. **Outbox + audit trail.** Write domain changes and emitted events atomically, then fan out from the outbox. That prevents "business write succeeded but event publish failed" drift.
5. **Separate verification from execution.** The worker that changes code or data should not be the only thing deciding the result is correct. Run tests, schema checks, policy checks, and risk checks as a distinct phase.
6. **Human-readable review packet.** The terminal artifact should be a diff/change summary, checks that ran, failed retries, and any operator decisions still needed.

For your specific concerns:

- **Prevent cascading failures:** isolate agents behind queues and timeouts; never let one agent call another synchronously in a chain for critical paths.
- **Agent communication:** pass structured job payloads and artifacts, not conversational state.
- **Retries/idempotency:** retry transport failures automatically, but require explicit compensating actions for side-effecting fintech operations.
- **Observability:** log one correlation ID across webhook receipt, orchestration, tool execution, and verification.
- **Safe rollout:** ship prompt/workflow changes behind versioned configs and canary them on a small traffic slice before promoting.

If you want a concrete open-source reference for the `spec -> execution -> verification -> reviewable finish state` part of this pattern, Ralph Workflow is a useful example: [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/RalphWorkflow/Ralph-Workflow).
