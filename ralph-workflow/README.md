# Ralph Workflow (Python)

Ralph Workflow is a Python 3.12+ CLI for unattended multi-agent development loops. The installable package lives in this directory and exposes two entry points:

- `ralph` — the main CLI
- `ralph-mcp` — the standalone MCP server runtime

## Install

### PyPI

```bash
pip install ralph-workflow
ralph --help
```

### pipx

```bash
python -m pip install pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
pipx install ralph-workflow
ralph --help
```

### Development install

```bash
make dev
ralph --version
```

### Refresh the runnable executable from this checkout

```bash
make install
ralph --version
```

`make install` updates the current Python environment and, when `pipx` is
available, force-refreshes the pipx-managed `ralph` executable so it points at
the current checkout instead of a stale deleted worktree.

## Quick start

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
ralph --init feature-spec
# edit PROMPT.md
ralph
```

## Verification

```bash
make verify
```

That runs:

- `ruff check ralph/ tests/`
- `mypy ralph/`
- `pytest tests/ -v --cov=ralph --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html`

## Package map

- `ralph/cli/` — Typer CLI entry points and command plumbing
- `ralph/config/` — layered config loading and Pydantic models
- `ralph/pipeline/` — state, events, reducer, orchestrator, effects
- `ralph/phases/` — phase handlers and dispatch
- `ralph/agents/` — agent registry, chains, and invocation
- `ralph/mcp/` — MCP bridge, artifact handling, standalone server runtime
- `ralph/git/` — GitPython-backed repository helpers and rebase support
- `ralph/workspace/` — production and in-memory filesystem abstractions

## Pydoc-first API reference

The public package docstrings are intended to stand on their own. Useful entry points:

```bash
python -m pydoc ralph
python -m pydoc ralph.cli
python -m pydoc ralph.pipeline
python -m pydoc ralph.mcp
python -m pydoc ralph.git
python -m pydoc ralph.workspace
```

Use package/module docstrings for API understanding and this README for workflow-level guidance.

## Parallel mode

When your planning phase produces two or more work units, Ralph fans development out across multiple git worktrees simultaneously. Configure it in your pipeline policy:

```toml
[pipeline.parallel_execution]
max_parallel_workers = 4
max_work_units = 50
```

See `docs/agents/parallelization.md` for the full guide.
