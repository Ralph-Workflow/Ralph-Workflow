# Testing Policy

## Purpose and scope

This policy governs how every AI agent working in this project plans,
writes, runs, and maintains automated tests. It applies to every change
that adds, modifies, or removes behaviour that could regress without a
test. It does NOT govern manual exploratory testing, end-to-end smoke
checks performed by humans, or third-party hosted service reliability.

## Default requirements

* The test suite MUST be black-box by default: tests assert observable
  behaviour through the project's public surface (CLI entry points, MCP
  tool handlers, library exports, HTTP endpoints, CLI outputs). White-box
  tests that reach into private internals are permitted only when no
  observable surface can express the regression.
* When a behaviour cannot be expressed through the public surface
  cleanly, the agent MUST refactor the production boundary (extract an
  interface, add a seam, return a typed value) so a black-box test is
  possible. Defaulting to white-box coupling is a design defect.
* Narrower unit tests are appropriate for pure functions, parsers,
  validators, and decision tables where every branch is reachable from
  the function's signature alone.
* Tests MUST be deterministic: no real time, real filesystem, real
  network, real subprocess, or global singleton mutation. Inject
  dependencies through constructors or fixtures; use fakes and doubles
  for clocks, filesystems, and processes.
* Every bug fix MUST add a regression test that fails on the bug and
  passes on the fix. The test name SHOULD encode the regression so
  future readers understand the contract.
* Every new behaviour MUST add at least one positive test (the behaviour
  works as documented) and one negative test (the behaviour rejects
  invalid input).

## Project facts to resolve

The `RALPH-FACT:` lines below record verified project facts. Agents rely
on them when enforcing this policy and MUST keep them current as the
project evolves.

RALPH-FACT: test_command: PROJECT-FACT-UNRESOLVED
RALPH-FACT: test_command_prerequisites: PROJECT-FACT-UNRESOLVED
RALPH-FACT: primary_test_framework: PROJECT-FACT-UNRESOLVED
RALPH-FACT: secondary_test_frameworks: PROJECT-FACT-UNRESOLVED
RALPH-FACT: test_isolation_strategy: PROJECT-FACT-UNRESOLVED
RALPH-FACT: flake_policy: PROJECT-FACT-UNRESOLVED
RALPH-FACT: regression_test_convention: PROJECT-FACT-UNRESOLVED

## AI execution instructions

To follow this policy, an agent making any change MUST:

* WRITE the test before the production change when fixing a bug or
  adding behaviour; watch it fail for the expected reason first.
* PREFER existing test helpers, fixtures, and utilities. Do not add a
  new testing dependency when the existing stack can express the case.
* AVOID adding a dependency, abstraction, or numeric target without
  demonstrated need from a failing test or observed behaviour.
* RUN every `RALPH-COMMAND:` gate declared under Verification before
  claiming the change complies, and report the actual outcome. Never
  report a command that was not run.
* UPDATE this policy (facts, commands, requirements) in the same
  workflow that changes the test command, framework, or isolation
  strategy.

An agent MUST NOT:

* Default to white-box tests that couple to private internals.
* Weaken the testing gate to obtain a passing result (no skipping tests,
  no lowering coverage thresholds, no `--continue-on-collection-errors`).
* Introduce real `time.sleep()`, real filesystem I/O, or real network
  I/O in tests. Use fakes and dependency injection.

## Verification

Run every gate below before claiming a change complies with this policy.

RALPH-COMMAND: PROJECT-FACT-UNRESOLVED

The expected successful result is a deterministic test suite that
finishes within the project's documented budget. On failure, report the
failing test names and the failure category (assertion failure,
collection error, timeout, environmental). Never ignore or skip a
failure to obtain green.

## Exceptions

A narrower scope (e.g. no negative tests for purely declarative YAML
schemas) requires a documented rationale in this section, the scope of
the exception, and the owner of the exception. Exceptions expire at the
next policy review; an expired exception without an updated rationale
is treated as a violation.

## Maintenance triggers

This policy MUST be reviewed in the same workflow as any of:

* The test framework, test runner, or test command changes.
* A new test layer (unit / integration / end-to-end / contract) is
  introduced.
* The test isolation strategy or fake-injection pattern changes.
* Coverage thresholds, mutation testing, or other quality bars are
  changed.
* A new test dependency is added or an existing one is replaced.

## Living document contract

This policy is a living document. It MUST evolve as the project grows:
update the resolved facts, commands, and requirements whenever verified
project reality changes (new frameworks, new commands, new structure).
Two guardrails bound every amendment:

* Conflicts between starter boilerplate and the project's established
  practice are resolved in favor of the existing project policy — adapt
  this file to the project, never the reverse.
* An amendment MUST NOT subvert the INTENT of this policy. Weakening,
  disabling, or deleting a requirement so that a failing change passes is
  forbidden; evolution clarifies and extends, it does not water down.

## Ralph markers

* Policy id: `<!-- ralph-policy-id: testing-policy.md -->`
* Schema version: `<!-- ralph-policy-schema: v1 -->`
* Completion marker: the `ralph-policy-complete` comment; its presence
  certifies this file passed validation when it was last amended.
