### RalphWorkflow Conversion
- **Hosted docs/site conversion improvement**: Strengthened the live docs homepage hero so the two highest-intent next steps are above the fold: a primary CTA to run a real first task and a secondary CTA to inspect a public example review bundle before installing.
  - Commit: `cc3daafe` — `Strengthen docs homepage proof CTA`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: the current bottleneck is still conversion to free use, and the live homepage was still asking visitors to choose a generic “Get started” path before seeing the strongest trust asset. Putting the free/open-source positioning, proof-first CTA, and the “would I merge this?” evaluation directly in the hero should reduce drop-off from high-intent visitors who want either the fastest honest first run or proof before they commit time.
- **Public proof-asset publish + distribution improvement**: Published and pushed a real `example-review-bundle` proof asset into the public repo, including a sample `PROMPT.md`, morning-after result notes, review/fix handoff files, and artifact JSONs; then surfaced it from the public README, `START_HERE.md`, docs map, docs homepage, getting-started path, quickstart, first-task guide, and reviewable-output page.
  - Commit: `f239c27a` — `Publish example review bundle proof asset`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: the current bottleneck is still conversion to free use, and the strongest missing trust surface was a public proof asset people could inspect before installing. Abstract claims about “reviewable output” are weaker than a real morning-after bundle high-intent visitors can open and judge with the merge test.
- **Public repo/docs trust-path improvement**: Clarified and pushed the real first-run prerequisite across the public README, `START_HERE.md`, docs map, hosted docs homepage, and hosted getting-started page: Ralph Workflow is free/open source, but you still need one supported agent CLI already installed and authenticated on your own machine before the first run.
  - Commit: `c12a1e2d` — `Clarify first-run agent prerequisites`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: the current bottleneck is still conversion to free use, and the public promise was drifting a little too close to “install and go” without making the upstream agent prerequisite obvious enough. Tightening that expectation should reduce trust loss and first-run bounce from high-intent visitors who are ready to try Ralph tonight but would otherwise hit avoidable setup confusion.
- **Public proof-asset improvement**: Strengthened the public `free-open-source-proof` / hosted `reviewable-output` assets with a concrete morning-after review path, including the expected `.agent/` artifact bundle, what to open first, and the exact merge-test flow; also tightened README / START_HERE / docs-map links to point at that proof asset more explicitly.
  - Commit: `69782b30` — `Strengthen reviewable output proof asset`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: the current bottleneck is still conversion to free use, and the existing proof page described reviewability in the abstract. High-intent visitors need to see the actual handoff shape — diff, `.agent/DEVELOPMENT_RESULT.md`, artifact files, and the morning-after review order — so they can picture what “reviewable output” means before deciding to try Ralph tonight.
- **Public repo/site first-run conversion improvement**: Added and pushed a copy-paste "fastest honest first run" block to the main public README, root `START_HERE.md`, and hosted docs homepage (`ralph-workflow/docs/sphinx/index.rst`).
  - Commit: `e9a9043c` — `Tighten first-run conversion path`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: the current bottleneck is still conversion to free use, and even after stronger proof assets the highest-intent visitors still had to click around to reconstruct the exact first-run flow. This puts the install commands, a concrete `PROMPT.md` example, and the merge-test question directly on the primary public entry points so someone can go from curiosity to a real overnight run with less guesswork.
- **Public repo/docs conversion improvement**: Added and pushed `docs/first-task-prompt-templates.md` plus a hosted Sphinx `first-task-prompt-templates.md`, then linked the new asset from README, `START_HERE.md`, docs index, docs homepage, getting-started, quickstart, and first-task guide.
  - Commit: `8b0b38f7` — `Add first-task prompt templates`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: the current bottleneck is still conversion to free use, and even a stronger start-here path still left high-intent visitors staring at a blank `PROMPT.md`. Copy-paste prompt shapes for feature work, validation, refactors, tests, and docs reduce first-run friction and make tonight’s first backlog-task run more concrete.
- **Public repo onboarding improvement**: Updated `START_HERE.md` with a four-question opening, the fastest honest first-run command path, and a copy-paste `PROMPT.md` example for a real first backlog task.
  - Commit: `aea17f7a` — `Tighten start-here first-run conversion`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: the current bottleneck is still conversion to free use, and the repo’s public start path still asked visitors to “write a one-paragraph spec” without giving them the exact command flow and spec shape to use tonight. This makes the first run more concrete and lowers the gap between interest and actual use.

- **Hosted docs/site conversion improvement**: Added and pushed two new public Sphinx docs pages — `first-task-guide.md` and `reviewable-output.md` — then linked them from the docs homepage, getting-started flow, and quickstart.
  - Commit: `83a3fb4a` — `Add hosted docs proof assets`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: the main bottleneck is still conversion to free use, and the live hosted docs path was still weaker than the repo landing path. This puts the strongest proof assets directly in the high-intent docs journey: what Ralph is, who it is for, why it is different, why use it now, how to pick a first task, and what a trustworthy reviewable handoff should look like.
- **Public repo conversion improvement**: Added and pushed a real root-level `START_HERE.md` plus a stronger README opening that explicitly answers the four marketing questions and drives visitors into the first-task / merge-test path.
  - Commit: `01d8bd8e` — `Add start-here conversion entry point`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: the current bottleneck is still conversion to free use, and the live repo still lacked a true public start-here asset despite prior internal notes. This closes that gap on the public repo itself and gives high-intent visitors a sharper “what is it / who is it for / why different / why now / what should I do tonight?” path.
- **Public repo/docs improvement**: Added and pushed a new top-of-README and docs index conversion block that explicitly answers the four marketing questions and routes visitors into the right proof asset for their current objection.
  - Commit: `d7f2ac77` — `Sharpen repo conversion entry points`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: current bottleneck is still conversion to free use, so the highest-leverage move was tightening the very first repo/docs screens. Visitors now get an immediate "what is it / who is it for / why different / why now" answer plus direct paths for first run, task fit, worktrees comparison, and proof of reviewable output.
- **Public repo/docs improvement**: Added and pushed `docs/why-worktrees-are-not-enough.md` plus README / START_HERE / docs index links.
  - Commit: `e93df0dc` — `Add worktrees comparison conversion guide`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: Repeated market pain is "we already use worktrees / multiple agent sessions, so what does Ralph actually add?" A direct comparison asset is a stronger trust/conversion move than another generic post because it answers the differentiation question for high-intent users already close to trying the product.
- **Public repo/docs improvement**: Added and pushed `docs/when-unattended-coding-fits.md` plus README / START_HERE / docs index links.
  - Commit: `62cb7cb4` — `Add first-task fit guide`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: The current bottleneck is conversion to free use, so a simple good-task vs bad-task decision guide is higher leverage than another generic awareness post. It gives interested visitors a clearer first task, sharper fit test, and a faster path to an honest merge/no-merge evaluation.

### RalphWorkflow Distribution
- **write.as article**: "Claude Code + Codex Workflow: Plan, Build, Review" — https://write.as/vesqh0lzrm4en.md
  - Status: ✅ Published
  - Notes: Owned-content asset published as the primary non-Reddit marketing piece; positioned around reviewable output, proof over claims, and unattended runs that actually hold up.

### RalphWorkflow Distribution
- **write.as article**: "How to Tell if an AI Coding Task Is Actually Done" — https://write.as/7pqpd2y0v0re2.md
  - Status: ✅ Published
  - Notes: Second owned-content asset published; focused on proof of completion, reviewability, and the merge test as the real definition of done.

### Owned-content drafting
- Drafted site-guide assets:
  - `drafts/2026-05-16_unattended-ai-coding-when-it-works_site-guide.md`
  - `drafts/2026-05-16_reviewable-ai-code-output_site-guide.md`
- Purpose: convert current market pain into durable owned pages that can drive adoption beyond Reddit.

### RalphWorkflow Distribution
- **write.as article**: "When Unattended AI Coding Actually Works" — https://write.as/x5wil6pmtbvo1.md
  - Status: ✅ Published
  - Notes: Owned-content asset focused on when unattended coding is genuinely useful, how to keep it reviewable, and where RalphWorkflow fits.

### RalphWorkflow Distribution
- **write.as article**: "Reviewable AI Code Output" — https://write.as/lsgmbq5ok5cj7.md
  - Status: ✅ Published
  - Notes: Owned-content asset focused on the difference between raw AI output and a result a human can actually review and merge.

### RalphWorkflow Distribution
- **write.as article**: "Start Here: Try Ralph Workflow on One Real Backlog Task" — https://write.as/9fd522xefd86z.md
  - Status: ✅ Published
  - Notes: Conversion-focused owned asset aimed at turning interest into an actual first trial and a merge/no-merge decision.

### Conversion / adoption assets
- Added root `README.md` for RalphWorkflow with clearer adoption-first framing.
- Added `START_HERE_RALPHWORKFLOW.md` to turn interest into a first real trial.
- Added proof assets:
  - `content/examples/first_task_example.md`
  - `content/examples/review_bundle_example.md`
- Purpose: improve conversion from repo/site curiosity into actual trial and adoption.

### Adoption conversion work
- Drafted `drafts/2026-05-16_why-worktrees-are-not-enough_site-guide.md`
- Drafted `drafts/2026-05-16_trial-cta-snippets.md`
- Purpose: tighten proof/positioning and improve trial conversion instead of just adding more generic awareness content.

### Public repo adoption improvements
- Shipped conversion improvements to the public RalphWorkflow repo.
- Commit: `6ca12e02` — `Improve trial conversion docs`
- Added public `START_HERE.md`
- Added public `docs/trial-proof.md`
- Updated root `README.md` and `docs/README.md` to push visitors toward a real first trial and a merge/no-merge evaluation.

### Free and open-source framing cleanup
- Replaced remaining RalphWorkflow marketing/public wording that used "trial" framing.
- Public repo commit: `89345ba7` — `Replace trial wording with free OSS framing`
- Renamed public doc `docs/trial-proof.md` -> `docs/free-open-source-proof.md`
- Updated public README/docs references and internal marketing materials to use free/open-source adoption wording instead.

### RalphWorkflow Conversion
- **Public docs/site conversion improvement**: Updated the Sphinx docs homepage and getting-started page to answer the four marketing questions earlier, push the right first-task framing, and anchor evaluation on the merge test.
  - Commit: `55967acb` — `Sharpen docs conversion messaging`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: current bottleneck is conversion to free use, and docs visitors were landing on a mostly technical path before seeing the strongest fit / trust / why-now framing. This makes the docs surface act more like a serious adoption entry point instead of just reference material.

- **Retrospective source:** `/home/mistlight/.openclaw/workspace/agents/marketing/logs/reddit_post_analysis.md`

### RalphWorkflow Conversion
- **Hosted docs trust/fit-path improvement**: Added and pushed a dedicated Sphinx `when-unattended-coding-fits.md` page, then surfaced it directly on the hosted docs homepage with a new good-fit/bad-fit section, a prominent fit-check card, and homepage copy that routes uncertain visitors into the fit filter before they waste a first run.
  - Commit: `d088768f` — `Surface task-fit guidance on docs homepage`
  - Status: ✅ Pushed to Codeberg and GitHub mirror
  - Why: the current bottleneck is still conversion to free use, and the hosted docs homepage was strong on setup and proof but still weak at qualifying whether a visitor’s first task was a good unattended fit. Making the fit filter visible earlier should improve trust, reduce bad first-run experiences, and help high-intent evaluators reach a cleaner merge/no-merge test faster.
